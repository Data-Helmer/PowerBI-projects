Fp20dataanalyticschallenge

Overview: The challenge is to create a report that provides a sales analysis of the six leading mobile brands in the world across different levels: country, brand, distributor, and operator.
Analysis:
1) Columbia amassed the country with the highest sales, followed by Ireland and Salvatore
2) About 70% of the revenue came from three brands which are Apple, Samsung and LG which suggests popularity with customers
3) Tottus and Oeschie seem to be the best distributors. This suggests that they have a strong relationship with customers as they have performed very well in every country and are very effective in selling the company's products
4) Tuentin is the top selling operator

Recommendations
1) It is important to keep an eye on the  sales performance of the other three less solid brands. Are they performing poorly due to lack of customer interest or is there potential to increase sales with better marketing  or product development. This will help diversify the revenue stream and reduce reliance on the top three brands
2) It is crucial to evaluate the performance of the other distributors to find out why they are not selling as compared to  Tottus and Oeschie. it will be beneficial to provide support or training to improve their sales if it deems necessary.
3) It is important to understand what Tuenti is doing differently that is contributing to his or her success. It is also crucial to evaluate what others are doing to find out what they are struggling with and provide the necessary training or resources to help them improve. It will be extremely important to reduce reliance on just one sales rep incase he wants to leave
